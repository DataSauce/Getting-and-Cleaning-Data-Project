# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
Getting and Cleaning Data Project

This project tests my ability to gather, manipulate, merge, and clean data.

In the project repository, you will find:
  a README.md file reviewing the project and its contents
  a tidy data summary called "Summarized.txt"
  a CODEBOOK.md file that describes the variables and their factors
  a run_analysis.R script that can replicate the creation of the file
  
The data file was retrieved through Coursera: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.
I had to merge the training and test data into a single file, extract only mean and standard deviation columns, clean the data by adding variable names and factors where appropriate, and create a summary file of each variable by subject and activity.
